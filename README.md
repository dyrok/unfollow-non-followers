## üåü Features Your Mom Would Approve Of

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Configurable delays (because Instagram WILL notice if you go too fast)
- üîí Session persistence (so you don't look sus logging in repeatedly)
- üì≤ 2FA support (for you security nerds)
- üé≤ Randomized unfollow order (f*ck patterns)
- üìä Detailed logging (so you know exactly when you screwed up)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limit detection (with automatic pussy mode)
- üõ°Ô∏è Progressive delays (gets slower as you go)

## ‚ò†Ô∏è Before You Start (READ THIS SH*T)

1. **Backup your following list** (Screenshot it or use `cl.user_following()`)
2. **Turn off all other Instagram activity** (No likes, no comments, no nothing)
3. **Use a dummy account first** (Unless you like living dangerously)
4. **Don't be greedy** (See the ramp-up schedule below)

## üöÄ Installation (Choose Your Weapon)

### Method 1: Google Colab (Easiest)
[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J_ZPd4jPHfbRgWeYroOaPNhMWR7ip5W3?usp=sharing)

1. Click the Colab button above
2. Run the first two code blocks to install dependencies:
   ```python
   !pip install instagrapi
   !pip install pillow
   ```
3. Edit the credentials in the third block:
   ```python
   USERNAME = "your_instagram_username"  # No shit
   PASSWORD = "your_instagram_password"  # Duh
   ```
4. Run the remaining blocks

### Method 2: Local Installation (For Pros)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dyrok/unfollow-non-followers.git
cd unfollow-non-followers
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Ramp-Up Schedule (OR GET BANNED) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

Day | Max Unfollows | Notes
--- | --- | ---
1 | 25 | Baby steps, bitch
2 | 50 | Still warming up
3 | 75 | Getting there
4 | 100 | Now we're talking
5 | 125 | You're pushing it
6+ | 150-200 | Absolute madlad territory

**IMPORTANT:** During this period DO NOT:
- Like posts
- Comment
- Follow anyone
- Change your bio
- Basically exist on Instagram

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Newbie Mode (Recommended)
```bash
python main.py
How many people do you want to unfollow? 25  # Day 1 limit
```

### Custom Delays (For Paranoids)
```bash
python main.py
How many people do you want to unfollow? 50

Configure delays (in seconds):
  Minimum delay between API requests (default 2): 5
  Maximum delay between API requests (default 3): 10
  Minimum delay between unfollow actions (default 5): 30
  Maximum delay between unfollow actions (default 15): 60
```

### Max Safety Settings (For Pussies)
```python
API delays: 10-15 seconds
Unfollow delays: 60-120 seconds
Daily limit: ‚â§ 50 actions
```

## üíÄ Common Ways to Get Banned

1. Running this while also using your phone
2. Going over daily limits
3. Not using delays
4. Being impatient
5. Not reading this guide

## ü©π Troubleshooting

### "Please wait a few minutes"
- You went too fast, dumbass
- Wait at least 1 hour before trying again
- Reduce your unfollow count next time

### Login Challenges
1. Verify on your phone first
2. Wait 24 hours
3. Try again with slower settings

### Other Errors
```bash
pip install --upgrade instagrapi pillow
```
